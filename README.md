=============

GGJ 2014 Game

Fetchy fun times.

Some polish TODOs
-----------------

SFX needed:

- BGmusic (possibly multiple tracks as num happy people increases)
- Mayor fight music
- bartender shaker
- character "voices"
- cheesy footsteps?
- knife attack
- bittersweet victory music
- somber defeat music

- Visual Tweaks in priority order:
- punch-scale the Masks as you get them
- Blood particle when you hit the mayor
- Don't show "Looking At" gui text, somehow highlight the person you're looking at
